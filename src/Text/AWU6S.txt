A Wish Upon 6 Stars is an interactive lyric video website honoring the Crypton Vocaloids.  It was made as a collaboration between myself and an artist by the handle of @yuzu.yooja on instagram for the 2025 Magical Mirai programming contest (It's where the art for this site comes from!).  It features constellation-like lyrics that spawn in the camera's field of view, as well as procedurally generated particles.  Together, it creates an interactive experience that encourages viewers to "keep their head up" and look towards the stars!  Click on the image to try it out for yourself!
