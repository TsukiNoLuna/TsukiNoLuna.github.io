A first-person psychological thriller game where the player steps into the shoes of a college student trying to reconcile with their insidious past.  It began as a project from a team of two but now has amassed multiple collaborators!  As the sole programmer and director, I implemented the entirety of the game's mechanics in the demo.  I also wrote the overarching narrative and a majority of the character dialogue! Click on the image for more information!
