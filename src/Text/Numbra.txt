Numbra is a first person puzzle game based on shadows and light. Figure out the mystery behind the distorted physics, and use that to reach the end of each puzzle.  Created with a team of USC students for the 2025 Epic MegaJam.  My contributions include implementing the main mechanic using the Unreal gameplay ability system.  Click on the image to try it out!
