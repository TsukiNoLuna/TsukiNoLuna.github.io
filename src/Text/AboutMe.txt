Hello, my name is Luna Gary! I'm a game development and computer science student at USC. While my main focus lies within game engineering, I also hold interests in web development and deep learning research. newline My ever-present ambition is to create art that resonates with people.  I still cling to that feeling I get when I interact with one of those games.  The games that cross the boundaries of the medium to unobstructedly deliver the developer's vision for the experience.  As I gain more experience, I aspire to use my technical ability to create games that can in turn inspire the same feeling of intimacy and envelopment. newline Outside of working on games, I love to explore the bounds of food with modernist cooking techniques, stargaze (if this website wasn't indication enough), and translate Japanese songs to English.  My four favorite games (because I can't choose one) are Trails in the Sky: The Third, Dark Souls, Hollow Knight, and Tales of Vesperia. Please enjoy my portfolio!
