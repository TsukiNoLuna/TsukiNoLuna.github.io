Growing up, I  have always been drawn to the shows with strong fan communities. Shows like Attack on Titan or Breaking Bad, where the online conversation and plot theories are almost as engaging as the show itself. I wouldn’t say I’m in a fandom or deep in any fandom, but I do scroll through TikTok comment sections or youtube comments pretty often, curious about what people think about the latest episodes that dropped or such. After reading this week’s material, I realized how much fandom and media circulation depend on the shared experience of the viewers, even across countries. Jenkins and Zhou describe fandoms as things that move “on the ground,” shaped by local thoughts and interpretations rather than just global internet trends. According to Jenkins & Zhou the text states, “Fandoms comprise some of the most passionate, connected, creative, critical, and/or active fans. Fandoms give them an outlet through which they celebrate, support, critique, reimagine, and derive pleasure from the activities related to their fan object.” (Jenkins & Zhou, 5). The quote exemplifies how the online sharing of thoughts, opinions, and even other forms of media…about media is how the image and essence of a film or show is looked at in society. A good example of this is a Youtube group called RDC World, where they create skits about different anime but the characters are an exaggerated view of a character in the spectators eyes. exemplifies how the online sharing of thoughts, opinions, and even other forms of media…about media is how the image and essence of a film or show is looked at in society.
